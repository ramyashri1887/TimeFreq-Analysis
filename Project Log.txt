STFT Theory : Time spent (1 and 1/2 hour)
Issues with DFT ? Need for STFT ?

We know the frequency components present in the signal for the entire lenght , but we don't exactly know when these frequency components occur.
    STFT: Let me introduce myself.

Audio data is dynamic and we want to know how the frequencies evolve over time.
We don't want a still image of frequencies , we want a video showing the evolution of frequencies over time.

How do we do this?
    Consider small chunks and apply fft locally. HeheXD done.DIS SIMPLE DA!!
   
How to chunk? Windowing function: A pulse of some width(window size) with height 1.

       Frame size (no of samples to which dft is applied ) vs window size (size of the window function )
       Similarity: both are measured in number of samples .
       Difference : They refer to two different things.
       Frame size sometimes can be larger than the window size, in which case the elements outside the window are zero padded.
       So, Window size != Frame size possible 

Overlapping frames 

    Hop size (H): How many samples we slide to the right when we move to the nxt frame, or in other words number of samples between two consequtive frames.

Need for overlapping frames ?
Findout 
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Mathematics : Derived from DFT equation.
DFT equation = x(k)= summation(0,n) x(n) * e^ (j *w) 
STFT equation = S(k,m) = summation(0,n) * x( n + m H ) * e ^ ( j * w ) ; S is a function of both frequency and time (m , frame number), mH represents the first element of the current frame. 
Doubt: why signal is shifted and not the window, why do we even neeed a window. Equation is confusing 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Difference: Summation variable N in DFT spans the entire duration of time, whilst in STFT N equals the frame rate which is in turn the number of samples.

Output size STFT = (#frequency bins, #time)                           vs               OUTPUT SIZE DFT = (#frequency bins)
2D spectral matrix with complex coefficients wrt time and freq                         Spectral vector with N   fourier coefficients 
Frequency bins in STFT = framesize/2 +1 (symmetry in DFT)                              Frequency bins in DFT = No of samples 
Time bins = (signal size - frame size / hop size) + 1                                  Concept of time doesn't exist in DFT
WHY?
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Example signal : size 10K, hop size 500; frame size 1K, calculate the output shape ? Output shape : ( f, t).
f= 501 (framesize/2 +1)
t= 9K/0.5K+1= 19
So output shape = (501, 19)

STFT Parameters :
Frame Size: Usually a power of 2. Reason : fft used to calculate dft.

512, 1024, 2048 etc.

SOOOOOOOOOPER IMPORTANT TRADEOFF: Time frequency Tradeoff ðŸ˜±
Increasing the frequency resolution means increasing the the frame size which in turn means increasing the including bigger chunks so lesser time resolution.
Increasing the time resoltion , means taking smaller chunks, and hence lesser frequency resolution.

Hop size: Powers of 2
256,512,1024
or fractions of frame size (K): 1/2 K, 1/4 K etc.

Windowing function: Rectangle function never used because of discountinuities at the edge.
Why cant we have discontinuities at the edge?
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
We use Hann function ; kinda bell curve , but is a shifted cos() function which kinda modulates the values of the signal in the frame.

Visualisaing sound ?
#SPECTROGRAM! Yay heatmap  
But the output of STFT are complex coeficients , we take the square of them , making it real (x x* is |x|^2 )
So spectrogram is the square of the magnitude of the complex coefficients that comes out of the STFT equation, plot into a heat map 

Spectrogram is the most important feature !!!!!!!!!!!!! since it not only has the frequency components but also how it evolves over time this form of representation is called time=frequency representation.
Spectrograms are amazing. 

Try coding it and understand it (30 min)

Skimmed through the paper 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00043.pdf

What's time frequency analysis?
Analysing signals with two independant parameters , time and frequency simlutaeneously. Signal a function of time and frequency is prepreprocessed.

Types of time frequency analysis/formulations?

- Short time fourier transform 
- Wavelet tranform; discrete time is haar , and continous time is morlet.
**we'll study wavelets extensively 
-Wigner distribution , bilinear time frequency distribution 
-Modified wigner distribution 
-Hilbert-huang transform 
-

What are gravitional waves?

Study STFT and learn the implemetation if posible
