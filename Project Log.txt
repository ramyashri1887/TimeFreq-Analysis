Skimmed through the paper

What's time frequency analysis?
Analysing signals with two independant parameters , time and frequency simlutaeneously. Signal a function of time and frequency is prepreprocessed.

Types of time frequency analysis/formulations?

- Short time fourier transform 
- Wavelet tranform; discrete time is haar , and continous time is morlet.
**we'll study wavelets extensively 
-Wigner distribution , bilinear time frequency distribution 
-Modified wigner distribution 
-Hilbert-huang transform 
-

What are gravitional waves?

Study STFT and learn the implemetation if posible
